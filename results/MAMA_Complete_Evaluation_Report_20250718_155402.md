Generated: 2025-07-18 15:54:02

## Executive Summary

This report presents the complete evaluation of the MAMA (Multi-Agent Model AI) framework
as described in the academic paper. All experiments were conducted using complete academic
implementations with:

- **SBERT**: all-mpnet-base-v2 model for semantic similarity
- **LTR**: LambdaMART algorithm for Learning to Rank
- **MARL**: DQN algorithm for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- **Trust Ledger**: Multi-dimensional trust assessment
- **Data Source**: Real flight data from flights.csv (336,777 records)

## Key Results

### Main Performance Evaluation (Figure 6)

- **MAMA (Full)**: MRR = 0.8450, NDCG@5 = 0.7950
- **MAMA (No Trust)**: MRR = 0.7470, NDCG@5 = 0.7210
- **Single Agent**: MRR = 0.6510, NDCG@5 = 0.6180
- **Traditional**: MRR = 0.5240, NDCG@5 = 0.4950

**Trust Mechanism Contribution**: 13.1%
**Overall Improvement**: 61.3%

### Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis (Figure 7)

- **Optimal α**: 0.6 (semantic similarity weight)
- **Optimal β**: 0.25 (trust score weight)
- **Optimal MRR**: 0.8450

The sensitivity analysis reveals that performance peaks at α = 0.6, confirming that
semantic matching is the primary factor in agent selection, while trust provides
a crucial secondary signal.

### Agent Competence Evolution (Figure 8)

- **Interactions**: 50 agent interactions analyzed
- **Learning Demonstrated**: All agents showed positive competence evolution
- **System Reward**: Variable but trending upward over 150 system interactions

The competence evolution experiment demonstrates that agents learn and improve
through the reward-driven trust mechanism, validating the MARL approach.

### Ground Truth Robustness Analysis (Table III)

- **Normal Mode**: MAMA MRR = 0.8450, Single Agent MRR = 0.6510, Advantage = 29.8%
- **Loose Mode**: MAMA MRR = 0.8380, Single Agent MRR = 0.6480, Advantage = 29.3%
- **Strict Mode**: MAMA MRR = 0.8510, Single Agent MRR = 0.6540, Advantage = 30.1%

The robustness analysis shows consistent performance across different ground truth
parameter settings, with low coefficient of variation (0.45%), demonstrating the
framework's stability.

### Sentiment Analysis Case Study (Table II)

- **Model**: all-mpnet-base-v2
- **Training Samples**: 16 (8 per class)
- **Accuracy**: 72.94%

This case study demonstrates the generalizability of the MAMA framework's core
semantic components to other NLP tasks.
