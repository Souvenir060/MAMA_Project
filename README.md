# MAMA Framework: Multi-Agent Multi-API for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition

Multi-Agent Multi-API (MAMA) framework for dynamic, trust-aware agent collaboration in complex multi-domain applications.

## Core Components

- **Prompt Markup Language (PML)**: Formal agent expertise definition
- **Multi-Dimensional Trust Ledger**: Quantitative performance assessment
- **MARL-based Selection Policy**: Intelligent agent selection

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Souvenir060/MAMA_Project.git
cd MAMA_Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiment Reproduction

**Complete reproduction:**

```bash
python reproduce_complete_experiment.py
```

**Generates:**
- Academic figures (Appendix D Figure B1, Complete 150 Competence Evolution, System Reward Evolution)
- Experiment data files (50-interaction and 150-interaction datasets)
- Academic experiment report
- Guaranteed identical results across runs

## Key Results

- **MRR**: 0.8454 ± 0.054 (61.2% improvement)
- **NDCG@5**: 0.795 ± 0.063
- **Trust Contribution**: 13.1% performance gain
- **Multi-Agent Advantage**: 29.9% improvement over single-agent
